# Advent of Code 2018 Tasks

My attemts at tackling this year's Advent of Code tasks, in order to learn Haskell on more practical examples.

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a day, and each such directory has `Main.hs` containing the source code and `data.txt` containing my given data set.

To try them out, simply execute `./run.sh` from any day directory and the program will be compiled and run, with `data.txt` given as an argument. If you're trying to run them on Windows, you're on your own.
