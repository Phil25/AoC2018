# Advent of Code 2018 Tasks

My attempts at tackling this year's Advent of Code tasks.

Source code for tasks are in directories `hs` (Haskell) and `cpp` (C++), each in their respective language. My data set for individual days is in the `data` directory, named appropriately.

To try them out, execute `./run.sh <path to source code>` (for example `./run hs/2.hs`) from root directory of the repository and the program will be compiled with its language's compiler, and run with `data/<day>.txt` input file given as an argument. If you're trying to run them on Windows, you're on your own.
